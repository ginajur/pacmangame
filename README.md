This assigment was an exercise in creating multiple PacMen, at the push of a button and having them nagviate at random speeds and velocities upon the Start Game button. As a fun twist, I made them Mrs. PacMen!

Developed as part of an assignment with the MiT full stack coding certification. 

# How to run 🤓

This file can run from the pacmangame.html file and pacmangame.js file, along with four png files, stored in an images folder. This can be ran locally. Store all files and image folder in one file location. 

# Roadmap of future improvements 🗺️ 

In the future I would like to add additional pacman characters for fun!
